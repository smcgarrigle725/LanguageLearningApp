However, the Fahrenheit thermometer broke recently and it will cost too much to fix due to material shortage but some of your processes need the temperature in Fahrenheit to function properly. Your system is still collecting temperatures in Celsius, so you wonder if you can derive or **predict** the Temperature in Fahrenheit from the Temperature in Celsius since it will be a hassle to fix the Fahrenheit data collectors."
